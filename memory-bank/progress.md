    - [x] `QuestionCard.jsx`: Displays image, prompt, textarea (consistent size), AI placeholder button. Integrates `AIHelperModal`. Handles local input state and triggers debounced save. Renders read-only view.
    - [x] `AIHelperModal.jsx`: Placeholder modal created.
    - [x] `CharacterWorkflow.jsx`: Top-level route component created.
