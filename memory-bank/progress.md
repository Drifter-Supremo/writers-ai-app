### Enhanced Character Workflow System (Major Refactor)
- [x] **New Structure:** Created `/src/workflows/`, `/src/workflows/components/`, `/src/workflows/configs/`.
- [x] **Config-Driven:** Implemented `src/workflows/configs/characterWorkflowConfig.js` defining workflow.
- [x] **Core Engine (`WorkflowEngine.jsx`):**
    - [x] Manages state (`answers`, `isLoading`, `currentStepIndex`, etc.).
    - [x] Fetches existing answers from Firestore.
    - [x] Implements step-by-step navigation logic (Next/Previous/Finish).
    - [x] Handles autosave (debounced) to Firestore subcollection (`answers/{qid}`).
    - [x] Updates parent workflow document `name` field.
    - [x] Calculates starting step for new vs. resume.
    - [x] Renders current step (intro or `QuestionCard`).
    - [x] Renders navigation buttons (above card).
    - [x] Implements View Mode layout (AI placeholder, collapsible Q&A list).
- [x] **UI Components:**
    - [x] `QuestionCard.jsx`: Displays image, prompt, textarea (consistent size), AI placeholder button. Integrates `AIHelperModal`. Handles local input state and triggers debounced save. Renders read-only view.
    - [x] `AIHelperModal.jsx`: Placeholder modal created.
    - [x] `CharacterWorkflow.jsx`: Top-level route component created.
- [x] **Routing:** Updated `App.jsx` route `/character-workflow` to use `CharacterWorkflow.jsx`.
- [x] **Data Storage:** Uses `characterWorkflows/{workflowId}/answers/{questionId}` structure.
- [x] **Fixes:** Resolved `useNavigate` error, image loading paths, intro skip logic, button layout, input consistency.

### Workflow Listing & Linking Features
- [x] Created dedicated `/workflows` route and `Workflows.jsx` component (displays start card & list).
- [x] Added "Workflows" link to sidebar navigation.
- [x] Implemented "Link/Unlink Project" feature in `CharacterWorkflowList.jsx` menu.
- [x] Created `LinkWorkflowModal.jsx` for project selection (using `project.name`).
- [x] Created `LinkedProjectDisplay.jsx` to show linked project name on card.
- [x] Added skeleton loaders for workflow list and link modal project list.
- [x] Replaced `alert()` with custom `Notification.jsx` component for feedback.
